# Courier_Management_DBMS
DBMS Mini-Project

This project manages the Database for a courier management System. There are users, 
delivery boys, drivers, and office staff. The service is available mainly in five cities, namely 
Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Bengaluru. Hence, there are five local depots. There 
are vehicles to commute from one city to every other city. Deposition of the shipment 
happens at the local depot, but the delivery is to the given address. The cost of a shipment is 
dependent on the weight of the shipment and the distance to be travelled. Users can also 
track the status of their shipment. Front end GUI is also available for users to add shipments 
and do CRUD operations on them.
